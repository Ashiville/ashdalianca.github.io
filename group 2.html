  <p class="w3-center"><em>PLASTIC POLLUTION : OVER USAGE OF PLASTIC</em></p>
  <p>  Our main problem is "Plastic Pollution: Over Usage of Plastic", and the people that has this problem is 27 out of 37 students in 7am-1 of Apec Schools. Plastic pollution is the accumulation of plastic objects and particles in the Earth's environment that adversely affects wildlife, wildlife habitat, and humans. This means that plastics gathered in the sea that affects the marine wildlife. Plastic pollution  does not just affect marine wildlife, but also the different bodies of water. It also affects the waterways of low lying areas causing to numerous flood incidents because of plastics that are clogged in their waterways.
 </p><p> 5  helpful tips on how to Reuse Plastic:
</p>
  

<p> 1. Create recycled plastic bottle supply cups; <br> 2. Reuse coffee creamer containers for snack storage; <br> 3. Make a DIY plastic bottle planter; <br> 4. Upcycle laundry detergent bottles into a watering can; <br> 5. Turn a milk carton into a garden scooper.</p>

      <p> The solution that we came up was called, Environmental Recycled Broom-Broom. Our Environmental Recycled Broom-Broom has a height of 81.5cm or 32in, the head of the broom has a length of 12.5cm or 5in, and the handle has a length of 63.5cm or 27.5in. We picked this as our solution because we think that this is tangible enough to reduce the plastic pollution. For us, our target participants will enjoy using it because it is very resplendent. And for us, our solution can implement the over usage of plastics. Our solution is made up of recycled plastic bottles that we think will be effective in reducing the over usage of plastic. </p>

  <h3 class="w3-center">Background of the Study</h3>

  <p class="w3-large w3-center w3-padding-16">1. Plastic Pollution - According to Charles Moore, Plastic pollution is the accumulation in the environment of synthetic plastic products to the point where they create problems for wildlife and their habitats as well as for human populations. By the end of the 20th century, plastics were found to be persistent polluters of some environmental niches. Sometimes they were mistaken as “food” by sea creatures. Plastics also clog the sewage system of low lying places causing the water to overflow and flood the streets.</p>
  
  <p class="w3-large w3-center w3-padding-16">2. They are everywhere - There’s just no getting away from microplastic contamination - According to Cathleen O'Grady, microplastics may be having a moment in the spotlight, as the public is increasingly aware of their presence in the environment around us. As more evidence of their presence comes to light, it becomes clear that we don’t know how big or small the problem is. A new paper in Nature Geoscience and some recent researches reports that microplastics could have travelled to some of the untouched parts of our world.
</p>
  
  <p class="w3-large w3-center w3-padding-16">3. Microplastics are raining down from the sky - According to Stephen Leahy, scientists discover large amounts of tiny plastic particles falling out of the air in a remote mountain location. Researchers found out that in that remote mountain region, there were tiny bit of plastics raining down from the sky, raising questions about the global extent of plastic pollution. Scientists recorded a daily rate of 365 microplastic particles per square meter falling from the sky in the Pyrenees Mountains in France.

<div class="w3-content w3-container w3-padding-64" id="solution">
  <h3 class="w3-center">How does the solution works?</h3>
  <p class="w3-center"><em>1.Roll the cardboard and use a glue gun or double sided tape to paste.<br>2. Cover the cardboard with any paper and use a glue gun or double sided tape to cover.<br>3. Set aside the cardboard/handle<br>4. Proceed to the broom hair.<br>5.Get 5-8 empty water bottles and cut it horizontally<br>6. Paste the empty water bottles on the bottom part of the handle . </em></p>
  
  <h3 class="w3-center">FEATURES</h3>
  <p class="w3-center"><em>1. The length of the parts of “Environmental recycled broom broom”.<br>Head / Strand = 18cm/7inch <br>Handle = 44cm/17inch  <br>Overall Length = 60.5cm/24inch
</em> <em><br>2. The materials: <br>Recycled waterbottles <br>Cardboard <br>Foil <br> Double sided tape <br>Glue gun
</em></p>
  
  <h3 class="w3-center">BENEFITS</h3>
  <p class="w3-center"><em>1.The people can make their own broom - since the materials can be found in their households, it won't cost a lot of money to make one and it's much more convienient than buying one.</em><em><br>2. Promote Creativity - it helps people be artistic in some way because you are making it yourself, therefore, you can decide on waht color will the handle be, add your own details, and more.</em><em></em></p>
